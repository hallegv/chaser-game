Chaser Game Final Project for CMSI 185: Computer Programming at Loyola Marymount University

"Swishy Fishy" is a chaser game in which the player is a fish avoiding being eaten by sharks. Once the fish and sharks collide, the fish's health begins to decrease. Once the fish's health is completely empty, it's Game Over.

To survive, the player uses their mouse to move the fish around and avoid the sharks. If they're in need of help, the player can click their mouse and for five seconds a mermaid appears to distract the sharks and Plankton from Spongebob appears as "food" which the player can hover over to "eat" and regain health. However, this help comes with a cost-- five new sharks appear!

If the player feels overwhelmed, they can click the space bar to eliminate a shark, but the game always maintains a minimum of five sharks on screen.

Try to survive in the dangerous waters as long as you can!

Game by Audrey Hammond and Halle Vogelpohl.
